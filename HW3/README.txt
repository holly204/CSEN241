Task 1: Defining custom topologies
Question: 
1. What is the output of “nodes” and “net”
mininet> nodes
available nodes are:
h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 h8 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7

mininet> net
h1 h1-eth0:s3-eth2
h2 h2-eth0:s3-eth3
h3 h3-eth0:s4-eth2
h4 h4-eth0:s4-eth3
h5 h5-eth0:s6-eth2
h6 h6-eth0:s6-eth3
h7 h7-eth0:s7-eth2
h8 h8-eth0:s7-eth3
s1 lo:  s1-eth1:s2-eth1 s1-eth2:s5-eth1
s2 lo:  s2-eth1:s1-eth1 s2-eth2:s3-eth1 s2-eth3:s4-eth1
s3 lo:  s3-eth1:s2-eth2 s3-eth2:h1-eth0 s3-eth3:h2-eth0
s4 lo:  s4-eth1:s2-eth3 s4-eth2:h3-eth0 s4-eth3:h4-eth0
s5 lo:  s5-eth1:s1-eth2 s5-eth2:s6-eth1 s5-eth3:s7-eth1
s6 lo:  s6-eth1:s5-eth2 s6-eth2:h5-eth0 s6-eth3:h6-eth0
s7 lo:  s7-eth1:s5-eth3 s7-eth2:h7-eth0 s7-eth3:h8-eth0

2. What is the output of “h7 ifconfig”
mininet> h7 ifconfig
h7-eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.0.0.7  netmask 255.0.0.0  broadcast 10.255.255.255
        inet6 fe80::7025:6fff:fe93:c4f8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 72:25:6f:93:c4:f8  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 72  bytes 5440 (5.4 KB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 12  bytes 936 (936.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

Task 2: Analyze the “of_tutorial’ controller
Questions
1. Draw the function call graph of this controller. For example, once a packet comes to the
controller, which function is the first to be called, which one is the second, and so forth?
The function graph is:
launch ---> start_switch ----> __init__() ----> _handle_PacketIn() ----> act_like_hub() ----> resend_packet() ----> self.connection.send(msg)

2. Have h1 ping h2, and h1 ping h8 for 100 times (e.g., h1 ping -c100 p2).
a. How long does it take (on average) to ping for each case?
h1 ping h2: 
mininet> h1 ping h2
--- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
100 packets transmitted, 100 received, 0 errors, 0% packet loss, time 101427ms
average is 


b. What is the minimum and maximum ping you have observed?
c. What is the difference, and why?
3. Run “iperf h1 h2” and “iperf h1 h8”
a. What is “iperf” used for?
b. What is the throughput for each case?
c. What is the difference, and explain the reasons for the difference.
4. Which of the switches observe traffic? Please describe your way for observing such
traffic on switches (e.g., adding some functions in the “of_tutorial” controller).
